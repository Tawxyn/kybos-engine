# 3D Terminal Renderer

This project renders a 3D cube in a 2D terminal using ASCII characters. It utilizes perspective projection to transform 3D points onto a 2D screen. The cube is drawn by calculating the positions of its vertices in 3D space and then projecting those points onto a 2D plane, simulating depth and perspective.

## Features

- 3D to 2D projection using perspective transformation
- ASCII rendering in a terminal
- Simple linear algebra operations for transformations
