# 3D Cube Projection in Rust

This project simulates a 3D cube projection onto a 2D plane using Rust. 
It applies matrix transformations and a perspective projection to render the cube's vertices. 
The code demonstrates fundamental concepts of 3D graphics, including perspective projection, vertex transformations, and rendering calculations. 
Ideal for exploring 3D programming basics.
